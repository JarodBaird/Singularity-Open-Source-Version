Copying and pasting a settings file into this directory (from /Defaults) 
will make the game read the copied file instead of the original. 

For example, copying ~/Settings/Defaults/Colors.txt into ~/Settings/Colors.txt
will make the game read the former file and use the settings it finds as 
defaults, then it will use any settings set in the later file as overrides.

This way you can edit the settings without having to create backups every 
time. 

Or don't. The only reason the game can do this is because it makes it easier
to test. I really don't care if you screw up your settings, you can just
download another set of them.
